# 📿 Zakr Islamic App

A lightweight, clean, and beginner-friendly Islamic application built using **C# Windows Forms**. This app is part of my training projects to enhance my Windows Forms and C# development skills. It features the ability to display daily Azkar, play the Azan sound, and manage Islamic resources via a simple desktop interface.
